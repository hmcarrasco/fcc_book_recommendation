# Book Recommendation Engine using KNN

This repository contains the Book Recommendation Engine project developed during the freeCodeCamp Machine Learning course.

## Description

The goal of this project is to build a recommendation engine that suggests books to users based on their reading history and preferences. The engine uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to find books similar to those liked by the user.
